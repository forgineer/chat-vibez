# Journal


This directory contains journal entries documenting the progress, decisions, and reflections made throughout the development of the Chat Vibez project. The journal serves as a minimal blog, providing insights into the "Vibe Coding" process, challenges encountered, and lessons learned along the way. Each entry is intended to capture a snapshot of the project's evolution and the experience of letting AI guide the development process.
