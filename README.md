# Chat Vibez



## Development Environment

This project is being developed using Visual Studio Code as the IDE. GitHub Copilot is the primary AI assistant, enabled through a yearly subscription purchased for $100â€”less than the cost of a yearly subscription to Netflix or Disney+.

## Contributing

At this time, outside contributions are not being accepted. In alignment with the "Vibe Coding" goals, this project is intended to have no contributors beyond the AI tools used by the developer. This approach is meant to preserve the experimental nature of the repository and to document what can be achieved when development is guided primarily by AI assistance.

However, others are more than welcome to clone this repository and experiment with it for their own learning or projects.
